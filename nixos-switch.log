warning: Git tree '/etc/nixos' is dirty
trace: warning: hart profile: You are using

  Home Manager version 24.11 and
  Nixpkgs version 24.05.

Using mismatched versions is likely to cause errors and unexpected
behavior. It is therefore highly recommended to use a release of Home
Manager that corresponds with your chosen release of Nixpkgs.

If you insist then you can disable this warning by adding

  home.enableNixpkgsReleaseCheck = false;

to your configuration.
